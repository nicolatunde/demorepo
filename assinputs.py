# Ask the user to input some text and check if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. `madam` or `nurses run` or `121`.
# Print a statement in the format “It is {is_palindrome} that {text} is a palindrome.”.

# Create a program that asks the user to input a password and checks if it meets certain criteria (at least 8 characters and not more than 30 characters).
# Print a statement in the format “It is {is_valid} that the password fulfils the criteria.”. `is_valid` is either `True` or `False`.
# Bonus point if you can hide the password input from displaying on the screen as clear text.
